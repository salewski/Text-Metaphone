=head1 NAME

Text::Metaphone - A modern soundex.  Phonetic encoding of words.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Text::Metaphone;

  # XWRN
  my $phoned_word = Metaphone('Schwern');


=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<Metaphone()> is a function whereby a string/word is broken down into
a rough approximation of its english phonetic pronunciation.  Very
similar in concept and purpose to soundex, but much more
comprehensive in its approach.


=head1 FUNCTIONS

=head3 Metaphone

    $phoned_word = Metaphone($word, $max_phone_len);

Takes a word and encodes it according to the Metaphone algorithm.
The algorithm only deals with alphabetical characters, all else is ignored.

If $max_phone_len is provided, Metaphone will only encode up to that many
characters for each word.

'sh' is encoded as 'X', 'th' is encoded as '0'.  This can be changed
in the metaphone.h header file.


=head1 CAVEATS

=head3 Metaphone algorithm changes

I have made a few minor changes to the traditional metaphone algorithm found
in the books.  The most significant one is that it will differenciate between
SCH and SCHW making the former K (As in School) and the latter sh (as in
Schwartz and Schwern).

My changes can be turned off by defining the USE_TRADITIONAL_METAPHONE
flag in metaphone.h.

Due to these changes, any users of Metaphone v1.00 or earlier which have stored
metaphonetic encodings, they should recalculate those with the new version.

Contains an explanation of the basic metaphone concept & algorithm and C code
from which I learned of Metaphone and ported this module.

This is the public-domain C version of metaphone from which Binstock & Rex 
based their own..  I haven't actually read it.
