1.96  Thu Mar  4 18:44:02 EST 1999
    - DumbFS fix, changed metaphone.c to metaphone_c.c so that
      the XS generated file Metaphone.c does not conflict with

Heh, what happened to 1.00?  Never existed, it was supposed to be the gamma
release of the pure perl version of the module.  Skipped straight to 1.90, 
alpha XS version.

BTW  The new XS version is about 40x faster than the old perl version. :)
